Not her hobbies, her dislikes, or the things on her mind when she gazes out to sea.\\nEach August, they rack their brains thinking of birthday presents for her, and yet her reactions to each gift are virtually the same.\\nThis continued until last year, when Freminet was given a nasty shock by a lizard that leaped down from the ceiling.

What happened to that lizard?\"\\n\"It attempted to open the box lid a few times, so I gave it back its freedom. Our acquaintance was brief indeed, but that was the choice life made.\"\\nThe Knave's voice was completely calm. Looking at the confused Lyney, she then directed a casual finger at a bird that was poking about at the windowsill.\\n\"Ah, yes. Not long after it left, the lizard became this one's lunch. Now it seems to want me to serve it seconds... Go chase it away.\"",
