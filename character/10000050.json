When he first arrived in Inazuma, he relied on his insight and communication skills to make friends with people in various industries.

Thoma would learn a lot of first-hand information from them, or quietly strike \"deals\" that are beneficial to the Yashiro Commission.\\nHowever, although Thoma has a vast network of contacts, he has never used it for personal gain, nor has he ever forced others to do things in the name of the Yashiro Commission.\\nSociability, precise judgment, and just the right amount of tact. Perhaps this is the reason why Thoma can thrive as a \"fixer\" in Inazuma.",

He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.\\nPerhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.\\nIn addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.\\nThere was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.\\nThe sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.\\nWith this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends.",

Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.\\nThis calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.\\nHere, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of \"repayment\" arose.\\nTen years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.\\nKamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:\\n\"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early.\"\\nCould Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.\\nThe storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.\\nBut after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:\\n\"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. You will certainly need me as a helper in the path you embark on in the future.\"\\nThe will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.\\nAs if to respond to Thoma's choice — on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze, appeared beside him.",
