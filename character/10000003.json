Jean was raised by her mother to be the successor to the Gunnhildr Clan.\\nShe was trained in all the things a knight must know and all the qualities they must exhibit, from discipline, etiquette and conduct, to knowledge of history and ballads, as well as maintaining peak swordsmanship and physical fitness. Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: \"For Mondstadt, as always.\"\\nSome time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say \"For Mondstadt, as always\" before learning to say \"Mommy.\"\\nAs a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, \"Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection,\" and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.\\nNow, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.\\n\"You have to give your all to do the right thing. Always.\"",

She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.\\nShe holds her fellow knights to the same standard.\\nLisa the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and \"enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady.\"\\nHowever, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady.\\n\"Jean is so reliable.\"\\nSuch is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.\\nHer only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day.

Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.\\nHer passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.\\nOne is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.\\nThe other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.\\nThe effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great.\\n\"Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.\"\\n\"Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?\"\\n\"...\"\\nHe is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.\\nJean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.\\nHalf a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.\\nAn expedition — how typical of Varka's character.\\n\"I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.\"\\n\"Leave it to me, Grand Master.\"\\nAfter seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:\\nUpon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt.",

Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.\\nOn the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.\\nThe title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?\\nMore than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?\\nBeneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.\\nThe wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:\\nFor Mondstadt, as always.\\nTo become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.\\nTo this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.\\nThe great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.\\nSo too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's.",
