The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.\\nThe automaton had but one question to ask Ei: \"There is no turning back from forsaking your form. Do you regret nothing?\"\\n\"Your existence is my answer.\"\\nThen, Ei transferred her consciousness into her blade, and thus was born the Plane of Euthymia.",

        "Text": "Before Raiden Ei became the Shogun, she was a samurai responsible for seeing that the previous Shogun's orders were carried out.\\nThe previous Electro Archon, Raiden Makoto, was no great fighter, and the things Ei had charge over were mostly matters of warfare and slaughter. However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.\\nDue to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.\\nThus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or Mikoshi Chiyo for karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.\\nAt last, the day came that under a sakura tree's shade, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty tengu would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.\\nEi let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade.\\n Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.\\nAs for the Kitsune Saiguu, oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries.\\n\"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content.\"\\nEi was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.\\n—But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely — just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.\\nTo this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree.\\n...Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever.",

Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present.\\n\"It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more.\"\\nThen, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.\\nYet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.\\nThis day, the kagemusha was now the true Raiden Shogun.\\nAnd it was on this day that Ei truly felt the agony of erosion.\\nAs time marched forward inexorably, even this blade, this sakura... All life on Inazuma would fade before her eyes.\\nThis was the foundation of Inazuma, and it was the thing that the Raiden Shogun must defend.\\n\"If you look at it this way, thinking ahead is not meaningless, nor is it vain arrogance.\"\\nHaving resolved herself, her life exceeded its mortal shell, and eternity descended upon the mortal plane.",

She had to reach Eternity.

Thus, you believe your present self is correct. Don't you?\"\\n\"But have you really been enlightened with new ideas? Or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?\"\\nTheir faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.\\nBut it was not this day. Ei knew well that she was not yet ready.\\nHer heart had been clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.\\nThe sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows. Dawn was coming. The samurai must take up her sword.\\nThis dream was ever so real, and it, too, passed like a shadow.",

She was not precisely someone to be trusted, but she was in many ways also Ei's best choice.\\nUpon hearing this request, Miko could not help but joke: \"Aren't you afraid that I might just sell this off?\"\\n\"You understand the value of a Gnosis. Even if you sold it, I trust that you would have exchanged it for something of equal value, and that is no easy price to pay.\"\\nWith someone of Yae Miko's character, it would be no surprise if she ever sold the Gnosis, yes, but she would not allow herself to lose out in any such exchange.\\nSuch, then, was the tacit agreement between the two old friends. Yae Miko understood Ei's intent and took the precious Gnosis with a smile.\\n\"Well, this is your idea, not mine. Don't end up regretting this, now.\"",
