Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.\\nLeaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.\\nAt this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.\\nThey would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.\\nWhen asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:\\n\"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.\"\\n\"I'll take responsibility if the plan fails.\"\\nAfter holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.\\nAfter that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General.",

Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.\\nAnd as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.\\nThe sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.\\nThese are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.\\nSome who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a \"kid\" who doesn't seem like a general at all.\\nBut to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for.",

Also moves together with your active character.\\n· Generates 1 Crystal Collapse every 1.5s that deals <color=#FFE699FF>AoE Geo DMG</color> to 1 opponent within the skill's AoE.\\n· Pulls 1 elemental shard in the skill's AoE to your active character's position every 1.5s (elemental shards are created by Crystallize reactions).\\n\\nIf a General's War Banner created by Gorou currently exists on the field when this ability is used, it will be destroyed. In addition, for the duration of General's Glory, Gorou's Elemental Skill \"Inuzaka All-Round Defense\" will not create the General's War Banner.\\n If Gorou falls, the effects of General's Glory will be cleared.\\n\\n<i>\"We have the high ground!\" Gorou can ever so slightly change the terrain of the battlefield to help win victory.
