You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?",

Her items can help adventurers get through their pressing troubles.\\n—At a \"reasonable\" price, of course.\\nAdventurers who \"have just received Dori's help in their time of need\" at the cost of \"paying a large sum of Mora at once\" often develop conflicted feelings toward her — somewhere in between gratitude and a grudge.\\nFor Dori's part, she considerately ignores the conflicted look on their faces, putting the fresh Mora in her almost-bursting purse and bidding them adieu with a contented smile.\\n\"Thank you for your generous purchase.

However, only Dori herself knows how many unimaginable bottlenecks she's struggled through.\\nThere was a time when orders from all over Sumeru just kept flooding in and Dori couldn't deliver such a giant number of orders in a timely fashion.\\nUnfortunately, the capacity of the usual merchant routes was too limited for the delivery of commodities in such a gigantic quantity.\\nMany members of Dori's merchant caravans suggested rejecting certain orders to dial down the scale of delivery and maintain a decent, stable profit — one that already seemed set to make them immensely wealthy, given time.\\nBut Dori took a very bold step: She accepted all the orders while starting cooperation with the Kshahrewar to establish new trade routes in areas that were known to be dangerous.\\nShe opened the new routes up to nearby merchant caravans, took the opportunity to found a commerce guild and put the relevant resources to good use, and finally eliminated the bottleneck that her business was stuck in.\\nToday, Dori's new, built-from-scratch merchant routes are seen all across Sumeru, and the good reputation of \"Lord Sangemah Bay\" has spread far and wide.\\nThe words Dori said to her caravan members have also become common knowledge:\\n\"I'm not some stupid toadstool. I don't cancel or reject any orders.\"\\n\"Every Mora that can be earned, will be earned by me. Why? Well, because it's there, of course.\"",

However, she was inspired by the failed attempt, ordering a large custom-made hourglass.\\nThat which was in this hourglass was not sand, but shiny Mora.\\nThat night, embraced by the music of jingling Mora, Dori slept soundly at last.\\nAfter that, Dori learned the trick to dealing with insomnia:\\n\"To sleep well, you must first secure peace of mind.\"",

The cost of raising the Sumpter Beasts was covered by the amusement park's revenue in no time.\\nDori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.\\nPerhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.\\nDori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.\\nSometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed —\\nFor the one who dwells in the lamp is a powerful fighter, while the one holding the lamp is the one who grants wishes.",

However, every once in a while, Alice will ask someone to send her new invention to Dori.\\nDori, for her part, will sell it and find a way to send the Mora to Alice.\\nSometimes, Alice sends the invention with an attached letter that tells Dori to keep the Mora for the time being because Alice is currently in a dangerous area.\\nHowever, Dori insists on getting someone to send the Mora to safe zones closest to Alice's position, making sure that Alice will receive the Mora at her earliest convenience.\\nThe labor, shipment, insurance... The various costs tend to amount to a fairly large expenditure, but Dori is never stingy in this regard. She even pays in advance.\\n\"I, Dori, never default on payment.\"\\n\"Also, Ms. Alice has expenses, too. I must make sure that she has Mora at hand whenever she needs it.\"\\nDori often repeats these words and, despite the trouble, repeatedly makes sure that Alice's payment is delivered.\\nThough Alice is no longer Dori's only supplier, Alice's payment is still a top priority for Dori.\\nPerhaps it's because Dori keeps a certain promise embedded in her heart — the promise she made to Alice the day they met.\\n\"You want limitless Mora? Sure. I can supply you with marvelous items of all kinds. But how much Mora you're going to make will depend on how good you are at sales.\"\\n\"Don't worry.

At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.\\nThe strangers explained the elder sister's situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.\\nThe younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:\\n\"It's alright. I just need some rest.\"\\nSeeing that smile, the innocent younger sister's eyes filled with expectation. She even began looking forward to playing together like they used to.\\nBut one day, she saw her sister gripping her chest while telling a story.\\nThen, when her frail form collapsed onto the bed, the younger sister reached out to catch her, only to find that her body was so very light.\\n...It was almost as if her sister were a feather, a feather that might drift away to some place far, far away.\\nLater on, the younger sister found a crumpled note.\\nIt was a doctor's prescription, with a list of herbs that were desperately scarce — the collectors who had such herbs were few and far between.\\nTo purchase those herbs would cost more than tens of millions of Mora, an impossible price for a family that was already struggling to make the ends meet.\\nThe elder sister always shook her head with a smile to dismiss her family's insistence on following the prescription. Perhaps she herself could only find the courage to glance at that note in the deep hours of the night — and dare to dream that she might \"live.\"\\nUpon finding out about the note, the younger sister put it into her pocket silently and resolved to save her sister.\\n\"I must make a lot of Mora.\"\\n\"With enough Mora, my family will never have to smile at me while swallowing their pain, and I will never have to lose anything due to lacking Mora...\"\\nPerhaps it was at that moment that the gods looked upon her with mercy.\\nBut to an \"ambitious\" person like her, getting a Vision was just the start.\\nIn the countless days and nights that have followed, she has constantly kept herself calm and clear-headed, telling herself:\\n\"Conviction alone is not enough.
