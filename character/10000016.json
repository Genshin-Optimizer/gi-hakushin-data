These events are routinely attended by enthusiastic fathers, eager to introduce their wonderful daughters to the young and single winery master.\\nThis is all highly entertaining to the other guests, who watch on and comment, mockingly:\\n\"We'd much rather Master Diluc stays married to the winery, given how good this wine is!\"\\nDiluc deals impeccably with all situations, no matter who or what comes his way.\\nDiluc is a fine young gentleman in every conceivable respect.\\n",

Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.\\nAs per his father's wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.\\nOver the course of his missions and patrols, the denizens of Mondstadt gradually came to know this young and passionate Cavalry Captain.\\nNo matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. No matter how big the challenge before him, his boundless courage always led him to the front line. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.\\nBut the words of praise he valued most of all were:\\n\"Good job. Now, that's my son.\"\\nHis father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.\\nHis faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.\\nDiluc was so young back then.",

        "Text": "\"Sometimes, life can change in an instant.\"\\nThe day that Crepus spoke these words to Diluc would turn out to be the latter's last as a Knight of Favonius.\\nFor on that day, a horrific monster attacked the transport fleet he and his father were traveling with.\\nThere was no time for Diluc to send for help. The monster was stronger than any foe the young Cavalry Captain had ever encountered, and overpowered him.\\nDiluc could never have anticipated the way this battle would end: His father, who had been denied admittance into the Knights and who was shunned by the gods, defeated the monster with an unknown evil power — before that same power backfired, mortally wounding Crepus himself. Crepus died shortly after in his son's arms.\\nWith a heavy heart, Diluc returned to the Knights' headquarters, only to receive an unthinkable order from Inspector Eroch: \"Conceal the truth.\"\\nEroch insisted that the incident must be portrayed as an unfortunate accident in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius in the eyes of the public.\\nSuch was the sheer outrageousness of this request that Diluc did not think it was even worth trying to argue.\\nDiluc's father had once said to him that the world would never turn its back on the faithful.\\nBut now, the Knights of Favonius trampled on his faith like it was nothing. He couldn't help but wonder: What was his father's view on faith in his final moments?\\nDiluc resigned from the Knights that day and left everything behind, including his Vision.\\nHe swore to avenge his father's death, and to find the source of that occult power which had caused his father's demise.",

        "Text": "After Diluc resigned and discarded his Vision, he handed the running of the Dawn Winery over to the head housemaid and left Mondstadt altogether.\\nDiluc traveled all across the seven nations of Teyvat in search of the truth.\\nAll clues pointed toward a behemoth of an organization: The Fatui. He learned that they made counterfeit Visions in secret, calling them \"Delusions.\" A Delusion could amplify the power of its bearer to its extreme, but also carried the risk of backfiring. That was what had caused his father's death.\\nWas it possible that his father could have obtained such a sacrilegious item in order to do good?\\nDiluc knew he may never know the full truth, but that could never stop him from pursuing it.\\nLike an eagle scouring the wilderness, he set off on his hunt for the truth. Determination burned like fire in his heart, unfathomable enigmas and unending battles could not sway him from his course. He pressed on relentlessly, scarred but undeterred, like a fiery tornado burning through the dense fog of mystery.\\nThe Fatui's rulers, the Harbingers, monitored Diluc's progress from the shadows. The prowess with which he laid waste to numerous Fatui strongholds caught their attention and forced them to take action.\\nDiluc narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Harbingers thanks to a third-party observer from the north, who was part of a vast underground intelligence network. The observer claimed to have been watching Diluc for some time, and approved of his methods.\\nAfter his close encounter with death, Diluc took a long hard look at his past and the anger he had harbored for so long. Acknowledging his shortcomings, he decided to join the underground intelligence network.\\nJust like when he first joined the Knights of Favonius, Diluc committed himself fully to his work. His talents and skills saw him rise steadily through the ranks into the upper echelons of the network.\\nThe network was made up of volunteers, and many of its members had willingly given up their prior positions and reputations to join. Some had even abandoned their names.\\nCould working with these new comrades finally restore the faith he once clung to? The faith that had been all but destroyed in the events surrounding his father's death?",

        "Text": "\"Shine True.\" The background to this motto is hotly contested, but to Diluc it has one simple, clear meaning.\\n\"Evil cannot go unpunished.\\nNever settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come.\"\\nDiluc's solitary sojourn lasted for three years.\\nFour years on, Diluc had returned to Mondstadt and taken over as head of the family winery, now a young man.\\nIn the space of these four years, Eroch had been purged from the Knights of Favonius after being shown to be a traitor, while Grand Master Varka had left on an expedition, leaving Master Jean to assume the role of Acting Grand Master.\\nThe return of the Dawn Winery's master should have been a momentous occasion for Mondstadt, but strangely it went completely unnoticed.\\nThe reason? Mondstadt's citizens were far too busy pondering the mysterious case of an unknown \"Guardian of Mondstadt.\"\\nAll that was known about the anonymous guardian was that the smell of burning would follow in his wake, and that a flash of red flames would reveal his silhouette for but a moment in the darkness of the night, before he disappeared in an instant.\\nThe bodies of monsters that had plagued Mondstadt for an age now lay dead in the wilderness... Mondstadt's most wanted thieves suddenly appeared bound and gagged, hanging from their feet in the statue plaza... All the Knights of Favonius were dispatched to reckon, once and for all, with the Abyss Mage behind countless crimes in the city, but they arrived only to discover that he had long since been killed...\\nAided by wine-fueled conversations, word of the mysterious guardian spread swiftly, and he came to be known as the \"Darknight Hero.\"\\nIn public, Diluc appeared to hold this hero in contempt, his face curling up in disgust every time the name was uttered.\\nElzer of the Mondstadt Wine Guild was one of the select few who was in the know, and once queried Diluc about this: Was his disapproval of the Darknight Hero just an act, intended to throw the knights off his trail and protect his anonymity?\\nBut Diluc simply frowned once more, and curtly replied: \"It's just a stupid name.\"",

        "Text": "Crepus had two regrets in life. One was never becoming a knight, and the other was never obtaining a Vision.\\nFor this reason, in the moment that Diluc received his Vision, he took it as a recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition — finally, he could make his father proud.\\nJust a few years later, his father died on a dark and gloomy day. The hopes and dreams that burned bright in Diluc's Vision were extinguished in the torrential rain that fell on that night.\\nNo matter how upright and good-hearted a person may be, death will still come to them without warning.\\nIs this where the tale of justice ends? Just like that?\\nIt seemed to him that his Vision and his status as a knight were both equally ineffectual at enabling him to protect the things that he treasured most. It was time to discard them both, he decided.\\nWhen he recognized his own powerlessness, his Vision became but a burden, of no greater service than a Delusion.\\nEmpty titles were of no interest to him. He sought after ardent flames that would burn brighter than any other, and an unshakable resolve. Only a firm resolve can drive the truth-seeker forward, and only ardent flames can vanquish the ice that freezes the hand of justice.\\nOn the day that Diluc returned to Mondstadt, he took up his Vision once more. The events of his years away had purged him of his childish immaturity, and turned him into a hero ready to shoulder his father's will once more. Each night, from the shadows, he fought for Mondstadt.\\nHe did not discuss the past. But he did not deny the past, either.\\nTo the lost, perhaps a Vision is a beacon of light given by the gods to help them find the path forward.\\nBut to those with conviction, a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far.",
