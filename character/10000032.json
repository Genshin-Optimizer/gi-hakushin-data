The culprit, Klee, was sent to the confinement room for seven days for mistaking the cave the adventurers were still exploring in for a giant rabbit hole and blowing it up.\\nHeckler suffered from a severe bout of diarrhea for a week after joining the team.

Please don't invalidate my team's registration with the Guild...\"\\nSeeing Bennett beg and plead before her eyes, Katheryne sighed and decided to spare him the truth that his \"teammates\" had long jumped ship.",
