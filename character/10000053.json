She has been raised in the Shuumatsuban since she was a child, and is extremely loyal to the organization.\\nThat said, her most prominent trait is not \"loyalty,\" but \"laziness.\"\\nLazing around is what Sayu does best. She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.\\nPeople who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.\\nHowever, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, \"It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things.\"",

This also holds true for Sayu.\\nAfter spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.\\nFor example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.\\nAt noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.\\nIt will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.\\nHowever, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.\\nEven gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu...",

It's because you're weak that you can notice those unseen moments that change your fate... The chances of escaping from here are slim, but that's what my ninjutsu is for.\"\\nThe moment the leaves fell, she disappeared. All her pursuers were incredulous. The tiny ninja disappeared as if she were dust in the wind.\\nThe next morning, Sayu struggled to get up, and found that the ninja pack strapped to her leg had long since disappeared.\\nHowever, a surprising object appeared in the same place instead — a Vision gleaming in the sunrise.\\nNow, with the power of the Vision, Sayu can wield a claymore taller than herself.

The longer Sayu remains in her Windwheel state, the longer the CD.\\n\\n<color=#FFD780FF>Elemental Absorption</color>\\nIf Sayu comes into contact with <color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro</color>/<color=#FF9999FF>Pyro</color>/<color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo</color>/<color=#FFACFFFF>Electro</color> while in her Windwheel state, she will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.\\nElemental Absorption may only occur once per use of this skill.\\n\\n<i>Sayu can pull this skill off with her eyes closed.

This skill then summons a Muji-Muji Daruma.\\n\\n<color=#FFD780FF>Muji-Muji Daruma</color>\\nAt specific intervals, the Daruma will take one of several actions based on the situation around it:\\n·If the HP of nearby characters is above 70%, it will attack a nearby opponent, dealing <color=#80FFD7FF>Anemo DMG</color>.\\n·If there are active characters with 70% or less HP nearby, it will heal the active character with the lowest percentage HP left. If there are no opponents nearby, it will heal active characters nearby even if they have 70% HP or more.\\n\\n<i>People who don't know the first thing about ninjutsu love to watch Sayu show off this skill, and some have tried to learn it from her.
