Haha, she's the type to keep to herself.\"\\n\"And, let's see... She's an alright cook. Could've been the creatures in that space tasting a little off in general, of course.\"\\n\"We initially agreed to swing by my place after leaving. I wanted to let her try my family's homemade sausages this year. It's a real shame she couldn't make it...\"\\n\"But enough of that. After all, what matters most about my master is her strength... and the sheer arrogance she has to go with it!\"\\n\"Hmm? Oh, no, I know what I said. I'm not being ironic, and I mean no insult.\"\\n\"As I, Tartaglia, grow stronger every day, I get the chance to know my master's strength anew with each and every sunrise.\"\\n\"When we first started my training, she only needed one hand to beat me. That was undoubtedly her arrogance shining through. But when facing a weak opponent, I believe that arrogance is an aesthetic unto itself.\"\\n\"To crush them outright would be unbecoming, yet to feign humility, only to turn the tables later on? That, dear comrade, would be far too deliberate.\"\\nIn the present day, this \"review\" of Skirk reached her ears while she was drinking in a tavern. She furrowed her brow.\\n\"As I've said before, I still communicate normally with those who possess some measure of skill. And the food in the Abyssal rift only tasted off to him because he's an ordinary human.\"\\n\"And about training — I don't really care how many hands I use, but I do care how many he'll have left when I'm done teaching.\"\\n\"He still needs to live in Teyvat, so he can't just make new limbs for himself with Abyssal energy like I can.\"\\n\"Arrogance and carelessness are both dangerous things. It's good that he wants to improve, rather than to show off.\"\\n\"Otherwise, I'd start worrying about finding his corpse in some strange nook or cranny.\"",

        "Text": "\"Let's go. She's not going to make it.\"\\n\"But, our orders were to...\"\\nThe young child held on to her broken, bloody arm, and watched the two figures before her through blurry eyes.\\nIn the end, the one who seemed to be in charge bade the other to stop talking. They turned around, then vanished into the distance.\\n\\nNot long ago, her people had learned that the universe held more civilizations than they ever imagined. In the past, the chance to interact with those beyond their world had been limited to a wizened, scholarly few.\\nJust a few months ago, the leaders had announced that trade relations were amicable. So why...?\\nBeams cracked and splintered under tongues of flame. In the infernal maw the little girl lay, suffocated by smoke, heat, and blood loss.\\n\\nAs the debris and charred wood that buried her were dug away, she heard a sound... Something squeaking.\\nHer eyelids had been crusted shut with dried blood. But even so blinded, she could sense the light's intrusion.\\nAnd she could hear footsteps crunching on scorched terrain, each footfall shattering the broken bricks beneath it.\\nThe newcomer easily freed the little girl from the wreckage restraining her. Then, placing one massive hand on her shoulder, they yanked her out.\\nThe pain of being pulled so suddenly made her think that all her limbs had been torn off at once. She cried — and as tears forced their way through her eyelids, they washed away the coagulated blood.\\nShe was surprised to find that she was still hydrated enough to cry.\\nBut the feeling lasted barely a moment. The next thing she knew, the agony sent her spiraling into unconsciousness.\\n\\nShe was surprised to wake up again. She had not thought she would be granted the mercy of opening her eyes a second time. Though her vision still swam, she could make out a bonfire, and the tall man who sat before it cross-legged. Off to the side, a hulking rat-like beast cowered in the shadows, inky eyes mirroring the fire's wild flicker.\\n\"Awake, then? Don't waste your breath on asking questions unrelated to your survival.\"\\nThe man did not so much as glance her way. He continued to tend the bonfire with his blade.\\n\"So. Do you want to die, or do you want to live?\"\\nShe wanted to ask him why she was still alive at all. She wanted to ask who he was. But he had warned her not to waste her breath.\\nSo the girl simply turned her gaze to the starry sky and nodded.\\nHaving received her answer, the man plucked his sword from the embers, and slew the rat-like beast in one swing. He cut the meat from its legs, skewered the chunks using his weapon, and cooked them over the open fire. At last, he stood up — something he seldom did — and shoved the meat between her teeth. Bland as it was, the oiliness of the fat was more than a feast for the starving girl.\\n\\nAt the very least, he didn't ask her to feed herself. It seemed he understood that her limbs were ruined beyond repair.",

Order, by contrast, can be assembled a thousand different ways.\"\\n\"The people of your planet once relied on their great adaptability to make contact with the Abyss, and even after death, the lingering power they carried retains some... trace records of this. That power is similar in essence to my own.\"\\n\"So I wove together the dying echoes of countless souls, and spent quite some time learning from them — half a day or so, I believe.\"\\n\"Just to learn our language? Then, my father and mother...\"\\n\"Are dead. Devoured as meager meat for strength — gulped down like scraps.\"\\nThe man answered the second question, then continued:\\n\"At first, I believed those people went through the trouble of eradicating all life on this planet because there was something worth destroying. Some incredible technology with which the Abyss might be wielded, perhaps.\"\\n\"But I was mistaken. Your methods are crude, your technologies primitive. One might think your civilization lacked even one individual who possessed any ambition — or strength — in all its history.\"\\n\"You...!\"\\n\"Are you not the same? Did you not eat the flesh of the creature that dug you out of the ruins?\"\\n\"Though, I should mention I brought it here from another planet, since all life on yours is extinct.\"\\n\"I doubt I will even find a single species adept at looking for things here.\"\\nThe girl wanted to say something, but no words rose to her lips. Instead, she decided to ask something else.\\n\"Why am I still alive?\"\\n\"Your civilization coexisted with the Abyss. Though none ever used it directly, each and every one of you was tainted in some way.\"\\n\"This strengthened your constitutions slightly. Had an ordinary human been in your place, they would have been suffocated, roasted, then crushed by the collapsing ceiling.\"\\n\"So you can use this power to get stronger?\"\\nThe man's eyes glinted in the firelight, a perceptible change within them. \"Do you wish to become stronger?\"\\nThe girl nodded.\\n\"Even if it costs you everything? Even if you are judged and damned for using foul means to emerge victorious... Do you still wish to become stronger?\"\\n\\nThe girl answered, her words blown away by the winds sweeping that desolate planet.",

When the fruit of a tree dies, its seeds are sown in the rotten soil. Naturally, these seeds may grow into stronger trees that bear harvests a hundred, or even a thousand times richer.\"\\n\"Even if only one or two survivors escape a doomed world, their will alone can become strong enough to reforge the very world they lost.\"\\nWith their parting imminent, Skirk no longer bothered to feign reverence or obedience.\\nFear only serves as a spur for the weak.

        "Text": "The \"Seven-Shifting Serpent\" is a little trick that The Foul passed down to Skirk.\\nIt was originally known as \"Chaos Permeation,\" a minor spell developed by Khaenri'ah's Universitas Magistrorum, and it was made to mock Teyvat's wielders of elemental power. Users of this spell could use Abyssal energy to evoke effects similar to the Elements. The underlying principle was analogous to using the Abyss to permeate reality, creating specific forms of negative pressure to thereby call upon the flow of a corresponding Element's energy.\\nTo Khaenri'ah, \"Chaos Permeation\" was a mere party trick employed in performances and parades.\\n\\nAs a warrior, The Foul knew nothing of this technique at first. But as his understanding of Abyssal power deepened, he came to master it almost instantly. While ordinary performers could spend months practicing the shifting of a single Element just to scrape by as street entertainers, The Foul was able to effortlessly cycle through all seven on his first attempt.\\nHe passed this technique down to Skirk, but not so she could fall back on performances if she was strapped for Mora. After all, demonstrating mastery of Abyssal techniques across the seven surface nations was something only a glutton for punishment would do.\\n\"In my homeland, the Seven Elements represent the natural order of things.
