But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.\\nFor example, she almost never considers \"negotiation\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \"threats\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?\\nShe has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.\\nFor example: Why do we need to pay for food?\\nIs there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?\\nShe even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.\\nIn a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.\\nMuch like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.\\nMountain Shaper once had this to say about her:\\n\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\"\\n\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\"\\n\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\"",

If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.\\nWhen she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.\\nOver time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.\\nHe left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.\\nAt last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.\\nHer father had brought with him a secret art known as \"Fate Transference\"—\\nBy making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.\\nAt that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.\\nHe claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...\\nBut the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.\\nHer father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \"seelie\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.\\nStupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.\\nCrises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.\\nThis creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!\\nGripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \"seelie,\" trembling yet resolute...\\nSeveral days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.\\nTaking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.\\nIf not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.",

And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.\\nOn the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.\\nWhen the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.\\n...\\nToday, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.\\nThrough her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:\\nThe first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.",

Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...\\nAs the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.\\nWith the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.\\nThe vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.\\nIn the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate.
