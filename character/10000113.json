No obstacles in sight, only a vast plain of emptiness through which humanity yearns to soar, slaking its thirst for a life free of earthly shackles.\\nBut the fires of war spread ever beneath their feet, followed by cries for help. Even a Qucusaur, once wounded, is forced to descend to the earth.\\nIfa, then, is the knight whose eyes never leave the ground, out of both duty and habit.

        "Text": "\"If humans can be doctors to saurians, then saurians can be doctors to humans,\" Ororon once said.\\n\"...Not all juxtaposed statements secretly make sense,\" Ifa replied after a long silence.\\n\"Is that so...\"\\nIfa couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity at Ororon's tone, for the lad was no fool — just in the habit of sometimes spouting illogical utterances to get some reaction out of him. Ifa knew this deep in his bones, of course. But he couldn't help but look back on his life and wonder: How did he get here?\\nNo one can live a life free of things that cannot be helped. Being a vet, for instance, will always be like running a kindergarten — there is no controlling little 'uns who lack powers of reason. All you can do is comfort them... especially when pain must soon follow. Pain from wounds, cleaning wounds, taking medicine and getting injections... Truth be told, were Ifa himself one of those pups or kittens, he would scarcely have been able to tell the difference between those many pains.\\nAnd when hurt, they cry and they struggle. Such is the nature of all living things. Indeed, losing the ability to feel pain is akin to losing one's natural alarm system — worrying in its own right.\\nAnd as are the living, perhaps so too is life. Perhaps sorrows and partings exist to remind one that life trundles ever onward, that saurians and humans alike will grow up and grow old.\\nFor a doctor, this is par for the course. It's the price that comes with the profession. At least, that's how Ifa reassures himself.\\nAnd what he receives in return is love and gratitude from humans and animals alike, along with the bonds he has forged with many a \"bro\" of all types and stripes.\\nAs long as all joy could wipe away helplessness and sorrow... Then his fight would be well worth it.",

        "Text": "Sometimes, Ifa feels that one doesn't necessarily choose where they end up in life. Rather, they tend to slot into positions naturally over time.\\nFor example, he can't remember when he became someone who looked after others. The neighbors' kids call him bro (or big bro). Saurians, in both sickness and health, follow in his wake, croo-ing and crawww-ing all the while. His juniors and seniors alike tip their hats (where applicable) and call him \"Doc\"... Ifa can't help but feel fear take root in his heart at such treatment.\\nOf course, this respect is also a source of pride and satisfaction for him. So perhaps what gnaws at him from within is the fear that he may one day lose their trust. This spurs him to sometimes go to extreme lengths: making toys for saurian whelps, putting on guitar performances, hauling back bags of fresh fruit for his neighbors each time he returns from treating a patient... Once in a while, one might even spot him helping the tribe's kids with their homework.\\nIt was as though someone had messed with the passage of time. One day, Ifa was still vacillating between whether to become a vet or not, his memories of struggling up a saurian's back still fresh as new dew. The next, well, life had happened, and he suddenly realized he'd become a reliable grown-up.\\nNot that this upset him. In fact, Ifa was very grateful. It was just that, occasionally, the tribe's elders would bring up matters of the past, reminding Ifa of the boy he used to be.\\nSome young children love to hear these old stories. One of these young 'uns, who hadn't yet wiped the Volcano Cake crumbs off the corners of his grinning mouth, burst out laughing when he heard about how a young Ifa could barely get a book through his head. \"So big bro Ifa was once lil' bro Ifa! How crazy is that?\"\\nNobody had called him \"lil' bro\" in ages and ages. Ifa was stunned for a moment, but recovered quickly. He wiped the kid's mouth with a napkin, chortling, \"It ain't that crazy! How old are you, hmm?\"\\n\"I'm six!\"\\n\"Well, what do you know, little buddy? I'm five! How 'bout I start calling you big bro from now on, mm?\"",

        "Text": "If you count his distant relatives, Ifa's family is rather large indeed. Theirs is a household renowned for their veterinary skills, but on closer inspection, not many in the family actually pursue that line of work. In other words, neither sentiment nor logic dictated that he had to become a vet.\\nMoreover, studying for such a career is an exhausting process. Ifa felt that all he had to read while growing up were books on medicine, and the words and diagrams blew through his brain like a breeze — in one end, out of the other. Little Ifa angrily thought to himself: I don't have to become a vet, do I?\\nHe didn't have to, but soon enough, he found himself over the phase where books were beyond his understanding. Maybe it was due to their frequent visits to battlefields to tend to the sick, but Ifa's parents were affected by the Abyss, and their health was persistently poor. Although he was still young, some sort of revelation came over Ifa, and he often worriedly thought to himself: I... don't have to become a vet, do I...?\\nEpiphany or not, early maturity or not, Ifa was not yet full-grown before his parents passed away. After attending their funeral, the seventeen-year-old was overwhelmed by a hollow sensation. Now, he didn't know what to think at all.\\nAnd in the end, he became a vet.\\nPerhaps it was for tradition's sake, or mere force of habit, but Ifa soon became known as the sauro-vet with the finest skills, the gentlest temper, and the strongest sense of responsibility. Once his heart was set, his mind dwelled on other matters no longer. And as the war raged ever fiercer, his list of tasks only grew, but it was this very burden of work that helped him through a difficult period of his life.\\nNow that the war was finally over, Ifa found himself with time to sit down and think about his life. But really, was there much to consider at all?\\n\"Everyone's got something they gotta do,\" Ifa decided. \"And I just want everyone to be happy.\"",

        "Text": "If he gave himself over to his sympathy and adopted every wounded little saurian he came across, Ifa would have to leave his clinic for a life in the wilderness. He knows himself best — were he to start walking down this path, he'd walk it all the way. That's why he has an unwritten rule: If at all possible, he is not to take in any animals (or humans, or other miscellaneous creatures) long-term.\\n\"No, no, nooo way...\" Ifa shielded his eyes from his latest little patient's pitiful gaze, \"I'll definitely find this lil' guy a new home... but I'm stretched way too thin to keep him myself.\"\\nHis discipline over the years has been commendable — which is why he's still loath to admit that Cacucu proved the exception to the rule.\\n\"This lil' bro just doesn't grow,\" Ifa has a whole laundry list of excuses, ready to go. \"He's small, he's round, and can talk, but doesn't really know what he's sayin'... Might be dangerous to leave him all by his lonesome out in the wild like this. S'why I've taken him under my wing... Y'know, for now at least.\"\\n\"Actually, he's being taken advantage of. He's just too embarrassed to admit it,\" Ororon would say, laying the truth bare.\\nBut though Ororon would then pretend that the matter had nothing to do with him, he had in fact \"contributed\" to Cacucu's adoption by pointing at the vegetables in his field sporting prominent Cacucu-beak-shaped holes in their leaves, the gesture a silent accusation directed at Ifa.\\nUnable to come up with excuses, or shake Cacucu off in the slightest, Ifa was at last forced to (or so he made it look) adopt the former. He even offered to be Ororon's courier for a month to compensate him for the Cacucu-related crop damages.\\nBut taking a step back, this story actually has two gaps, to which Ifa has remained none the wiser.\\nThe first: The peculiar case of the field. Cacucu is not some foolish saurian, so why did he start messing with Ororon? In truth, the two had been partners-in-crime the whole time. For Cacucu to realize his lofty dream of becoming an assistant at Ifa's clinic, the first step was to get into the clinic at all. And to do that, they had to back Ifa into a corner.\\nAnd the second: Although Ifa believes the first time he saw the roly-poly Qucusaur was when he rescued him out on the road, Cacucu remembers another, older chapter to their tale. None know this, but Cacucu's mother was once badly injured, and she may have never hatched the egg containing this little genius of a saurian were it not for Ifa's intervention. And when said saurian pecked through the shell of his egg, he saw Ifa for the first time. Sadly, Ifa does not remember this.\\nOn the one hand, Cacucu lacks the vocabulary to relate the incident. On the other, there was never a need to, and so Cacucu has never attempted to inform Ifa. His mother eventually passed on due to old injuries relapsing, and it was a tall order for a small saurian to survive alone in the wild. Having not brushed shoulders with many humans at all, Cacucu quickly decided that Ifa, who had helped his mother once before, was a prime candidate to follow around. And if he could one day become an assistant in that clinic and repay the favor owed, then all the better. What a wonderful feat in the saurian world that would be!\\nWith the first step now out of the way, now came phase two of Cacucu's master plan: figuring out how to play dumb.\\nConsidering Ifa's personality — someone all too happy to shoulder other's responsibilities — knowing Cacucu's backstory could create in him an inexplicable sense of guilt and make him feel somehow accountable.\\nSo Cacucu decided it was best to skip all that nonsense. If they were to become bros, he wanted their bro-ship to come from a point of sincerity, unclouded by the past.",

        "Text": "In all seriousness, Ifa considered himself quite athletic. And between getting along well with saurians and passing his flying trials with flying colors, he figured he should be able to easily traverse all of Natlan.\\nSo he decided to swing by and visit the other tribes while he remained unburdened by much responsibility.\\nIn the Children of Echoes, he met the skilled blacksmith Xilonen. She proved quite eager, drawing up designs for Ifa's medical equipment without too much debate. He later learned that the Xilonen he'd met had been one very much burdened by responsibility — that of a commission from Mavuika — and so any work unrelated to it had been a breath of much-needed fresh air. Others said that Xilonen was usually impossible to get ahold of (on account of her making incredibly quick escapes into the mountains), so Ifa counted his lucky stars.\\nIn the Scions of the Canopy, Ifa felt a vibe similar to the Flower-Feather Clan's — that of everyone living life at their own pace amidst the clouds. He enjoyed his time there, slinging grappling hooks and scaling cliffs. His only regret was that he didn't get to meet that legendary \"Saurian Hunter\" everyone had kept talking about. It was only later on, when Ajaw swung by to visit his clinic, that he would see that wish fulfilled. It was a happy ending for everyone — well, except for Ajaw.\\nBefore he'd set off, Chasca had told Ifa about a guide he'd find in the People of the Springs named Mualani. His first two attempts to poke around her watersports shop proved fruitless, unless tripping over a Sharky Surfboard counted. Ultimately, he decided to take part in a surfing competition on his own, and it was at the prize ceremony that he at last bumped into her. Upon learning that he'd managed to score third place on his very first time surfing, Mualani showered him with praise. Such warm words from the reigning champ were certainly worth their weight in gold.\\nAs for the Collective of Plenty, their fruits were utterly divine, though the trip would have been much more enjoyable had there not been people challenging him to arm wrestle at every corner he turned. Sensing slim odds of victory, Ifa declined dozens of invitations under the pretext that he needed his hands to practice medicine. In the end, this chapter of his journey ended with him signing up for three months of fitness classes with Iansan — none of which he attended, even by the time he bade them all farewell with a hearty wave.\\nAs for the Masters of the Night-Wind... it was the closest to the Flower-Feather Clan, and also the most mysterious. Ifa wasn't even sure what one would do there as a visitor, so he thought he'd just stop by on the way home. As he walked, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, and yet every time he turned around, there was no one to be seen. Like an Iktomisaurus chasing its own tail, he engaged in this farcical waltz for a long time, muttering to himself as he did.\\nJust as he was about to leave, a cry of \"Ah!\" stopped him. Ifa spun around for what he hoped would be the last time. There stood a light-haired lady, one hand on her hip and the other pointed at him in anger. Before Ifa could begin considering what he'd done wrong, someone else grabbed him and made a run for it.\\nEverything happened so suddenly that the details were rather lost in the sauce. As it turned out, Ifa had unwittingly been dragged into a great granny-grandson chase, triggered when said grandson had decided to hone his invisibility arts by purposefully standing behind passersby. It'd even worked on the tribe elders.\\n\"My dudes, what are 'invisibility arts'? Do they even exist?\" Ifa's genuine curiosity and good temperament eventually quelled the wrath of Granny Itztli.\\nWhen he finally dragged himself back home, his parents asked how his journey had been. There was far too much to say, and he was far too tired, so Ifa just replied, \"Had a blast. Met lots of cool bros out there.\"\\nBros that I'm bound to meet again, he thought to himself.",

These hastily scrawled notes, replete with bland medical jargon, might never draw the gaze of anyone other than their author.\\nBut Ifa is not merely \"drawn.\" He is often deeply engrossed in leafing through these old files. As he recalls the details of each diagnosis and treatment, he may even sometimes jot down a few extra notes.\\nFinally, he puts the records back in order and returns them to their cabinet.

        "Text": "One day, noon came and went without Ifa's clinic opening its doors. Something was up, people were starting to say.\\nAt first, the neighbors thought that he'd gone off on call to another tribe and stayed the night there. It wasn't until someone brought a sick saurian to his doorstep that Ifa emerged, groggy and suffering from a sudden high fever.\\nBefore the visitor could even open his mouth, Ifa was already muttering, \"All good, bro,\" and giving the saurian a full-body checkup.\\nBut as they say, it never rains but it pours. Halfway through writing a prescription, someone else rushed in, crying out that an Abyssal incursion was coming from the direction of the Cinder City, and that a doctor was needed to save the wounded Qucusaurs there.\\nIfa, again mumbling, \"It's cool, bro,\" followed that rider to the front lines.\\nThe night after everything blew over, Ifa drank the medicine his neighbor gave him and passed out for an entire day. When he awoke drenched in sweat, he scrabbled at his bedside table for some water. However, what he found instead was a Vision.\\nDue to his high fever, Ifa's memories were somewhat hazy. To him, what had happened yesterday was little different from his usual routine, and hardly the first time he had forced himself to work while sick. In his eyes, he had done nothing special to warrant the heavens deciding that he totally, absolutely, needed a Vision right now.\\nEveryone else, however, had a different understanding of the matter. The chief believed this was a reward for his selfless work, while the granny next door supposed it was compensation for his spirit of self-sacrifice. \"Hey, hey, ma'am, 'sacrifice' is goin' a bit far!\" Ifa said to that, hastily waving his hands.\\nA child then said to him with wisdom early-grown: \"They say the wind blows people together. Maybe the gods are reminding you that you can rely on your companions when the going gets tough.\" Ifa didn't refute the kid. That was a sensible thing to say, after all. But then again, he had just let his instincts lead him to do what he was supposed to when the going got tough. Had there been any other option?\\nThey could have discussed the matter for ages without ever reaching a conclusion. Who could say? Perhaps the heavens thought that a cool breeze was just the right fix for his fever. Shaking his head, Ifa brought things to a close, letting the matter rest.\\nHe wouldn't even use his Vision most of the time — at least, not before he took Cacucu in. After the latter became part of his life, he insisted on having Ifa take him flying everywhere, punctuating said excursions with squawks of \"Higher, bro! Higher!\"\\nIn times like these, his Vision proved very handy indeed.",
