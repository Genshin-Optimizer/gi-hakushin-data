The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.\\nThus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.\\nYanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.\\nShe is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her \"the law that walks.\"\\nBut in truth, what Yanfei — one of the few half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis — really wants to do is live a free and happy life.\\nAs for the copy of \"The General Law of Liyue\" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:\\n\"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all.\"",

Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children.

Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.\\nThis steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.\\nYanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.\\nIn frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations.

In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.\\nThough this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment.\\n\"Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?\"\\nAfter encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.\\nThat said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.\\nIf such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.\\nFor someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge.",
