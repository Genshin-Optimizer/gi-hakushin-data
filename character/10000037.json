Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. \"What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished.\"",

Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.\\nOne such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.\\nGanyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.\\nLater on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.\\nHer colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.\\nThose who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.\\nThose closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.\\n\"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite...\"\\nNeedless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!",

They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.",
