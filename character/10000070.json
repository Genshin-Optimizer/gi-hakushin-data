This effect converts Nilou's Normal Attacks into Sword Dance techniques, and her final hit will unleash a Luminous Illusion.\\n·Whirling Steps: Nilou unleashes a Whirling Water Wheel that deals <color=#80C0FFFF>AoE Hydro DMG</color> and creates a Tranquility Aura that follows your active character around and applies <color=#80C0FFFF>Wet</color> to opponents within its AoE.\\n\\nNilou is unable to perform Charged Attacks when under the effect of Pirouette or Lunar Prayer.
