        "Text": "When Uncle Anpu, the village head, announced that a caravan from Sumeru City was about to arrive in the village for trade, the former Guardians could hardly believe their ears.\\nThey indignantly accused Uncle Anpu of undermining tradition and requested that Candace, the current Guardian, do her duty by summoning guards to drive the merchants out.\\nHowever, Candace refused the request, for she had already reached an agreement with the village head that the village must make changes for the future of its residents.\\nThey kept explaining, but the former keepers did not relent, and it was even suggested that if Candace was unwilling to do her duty, they would take up arms again and carry out a Guardian's work themselves. At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:\\n\"It is good to see you all in such good spirits.\"\\n\"But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should.\"\\nThe persuasive power of weapons trumped words at this moment, and it seemed that it would be enough to end the fracas.\\nAfter a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.\\nA few days later, the merchants visited again and completed this seemingly humble transaction regarding cloths.\\nThis batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:\\n\"Hey, you know what? Someone went to Aaru Village to do business — and they made a good sum of Mora, too. Think we should give it a shot next time...?\"",

From introductions to accommodations, she arranges everything in good order.\\nPerhaps she might even be too gentle for the merchants' comfort.\\nAfter all, this village is next to Great Red Sand. Leaving the monsters aside, lawless bandits must have long had this village in their sights.\\nIs the Guardian truly capable of protecting everyone... and their business as well?\\nOne night, a drunken merchant dared to ask:\\n\"Guardian, we can do business in this village, no problem. But as you know, this desert is a real den of outlaws...\"\\n\"You need not worry about this. Only those who obey the rules shall be guests in Aaru Village. As for those who don't...\"",

Their despicable souls shall find company only with the desert sands.\\nA former member of the Eremites once warned his companions that Candace, the terrifying Guardian of the village, is a true descendant of King Deshret.\\nThe shield in her hand possesses the blessing of Al-Ahmar, such that as long as its wielder holds it tightly, every grain in the great desert will heed her call.
